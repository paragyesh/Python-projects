Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in Python

Introduction:
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a classic hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand, and the winner is determined based on the rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.

Objective:
The objective of this Python program is to implement a basic Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user can play against the computer.

Implementation:
The program utilizes the random module to make the computer's choice randomly. The user is prompted to enter their choice (rock, paper, or scissors), and then the winner is determined based on the rules.
